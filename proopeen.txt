Snowblower Toro CCR2500 2-stroke
Engine speed: 3800 RPM
Idle speed: 2200 RPM
Displacement: 141cc 0.141L

Propane density:1.97g/L
Air density:1.225g/L


STOICHEOMETRIC RATIO OF PROPANE: 15.1:1 by mass, 23.9:1 by volume

For this we're going to assume 1/2 of the stroke is intake, so 70.5cc per revolution

2.8313cc of propane per revolution 0.0028313L

.00557771g of propane per revolution

needs 20.9g of propane per minute at 3800 RPM

or 12.2709639gpm at idle

can only run for 20 minutes at 3800 RPM with 400g tank

Bernzomatic torch:

1.206g/min of propane UPRIGHT
1.8 g/min of propane UPSIDE DOWN

NOT ENOUGH, WILL HAVE TO FIND A NEW SOLUTION
