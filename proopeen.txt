Snowblower Toro CCR2500 2-stroke
Engine speed: 3800 RPM
Idle speed: 2200 RPM
Displacement: 141cc 0.141L

Propane density:1.97g/L
Air density:1.225g/L


STOICHEOMETRIC RATIO OF PROPANE: 15.1:1 by mass, 23.9:1 by volume

For this we're going to assume 1/2 of the stroke is intake, so 70.5cc per revolution

2.8313cc of propane per revolution 0.0028313L

.00557771g of propane per revolution

needs 20.9g of propane per minute at 3800 RPM

or 12.2709639gpm at idle

can only run for 20 minutes at 3800 RPM with 400g tank

Bernzomatic torch:

1.206g/min of propane UPRIGHT
1.8 g/min of propane UPSIDE DOWN

NOT ENOUGH, WILL HAVE TO FIND A NEW SOLUTION

still assuming 70.5cc of intake per rev

2.8313253cc of propane per rev
67.6686747cc of air per rev

0.08289413g of air per rev
0.0054896775g of propane per rev

for a AFR(by mass) of 15.0999999545

Chemistry:

Propane combustion equation:
	C3H8+5O2â†’3CO2+4H2O

Atomic weights:
	Hydrogen= 1.008 amu
	Carbon= 12.011 amu
	Oxygen= 15.999 amu

Propane Mass:
	3(12.011) + 8(1.008)
	36.033    + 8.064
	44.097

Oxygen Mass:
	5(2(15.999))
	5(31.998)
	159.99

Assuming air is 21% oxygen by mass
	100/21 * 159.99
	4.76190476 * 159.99
	761.857143

real afr by mass 17.27684747261718

# 11/7/2023

Made the script ~/Propane_Snowblower_conversion/python/proopeenAFR.py
calculates the real AFR (by chemistry) and calculates the amount of fuel required for the displacement of the motor and the ideal and actual AFRs

# 11/8/2023

updated the script, now calculates air pressure at altitude, and accounts for that in the tuning



Now I can much more easily calculate my fuel amounts.

Real AFR(Lean, lambda: 1.1384602064662863): To run a 0.0705L(70.5cc) 2-stroke engine at idle(2200 RPM), one would have to supply 8.619485573480993 gpm of fuel, and to max out the engine(3800 RPM), it would need 14.888202354194444 gpm of fuel.

Ideal AFR(Stoicheometric, lambda: 1): To run a 0.0705L(70.5cc) 2-stroke engine at idle(2200 RPM), one would have to supply 9.812941325618349 gpm of fuel, and to max out the engine(3800 RPM), it would need 16.949625926068055 gpm of fuel.

1HP is about 2,544 BTU/h, with a 15-20% energy efficiency

A 400g canister should last between 46.4 minutes(idle) and 26.86 minutes(full throttle) on the "actual" tune,
and 40.76 minutes(idle) to 23.6 minutes(full throttle) on a "ideal" tune
A 1LB(453g) canister should last 52.55 minutes(idle) to 30.43 minutes(full throttle) on the "actual" tune, 
and 46.16 minutes(idle) to 26.72 minutes(full throttle) on a "ideal" tune

And heres the gas/petrol(E0) results for reference, everything else the same

(The fuel coming in must be 2% oil, this does not account for that)
